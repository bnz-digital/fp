## Introduction

**Functional programming in JavaScript is easy.** Easier, in fact, than OOP in JavaScript. Simpler. Cleaner.

So why do so many OO programmers find learning FP so difficult? In part, it's because they search online and what they come across is _academic_ discussions of the theory behind functional programming: Category Theory, one of the more advanced and difficult of the maths disciplines. And in these discussions they discover a host of obscure terms, such as _lambda calculus_, _referential transparency_, _recursion_, and the dreaded _monad_.

These concepts are difficult even for academics. **The good news** is that _you don't have to understand Category Theory or know  what any of these terms mean to write good functional code_. The way the code is written is quite simple and easy (until it isn't, but that's true of OOP as well, isn't it?).

Here we present the fundamental ideas behind functional programming without all the boring, academic details and terminology. You, too, can FP.

      <li>Functions take at least one argument</li>
      <li>Functions return exactly one result</li>
      <li>Functions can be passed as arguments to other functions</li>
      <li>Functions can be returned from other functions</li>
      <li>Functions can call functions, <em>including themselves</em></li>
      <li>Given the same arguments, functions must return the same result</li>
      <li>Don't be reaching outside the function to mess with shit</li>

      <li>Assign variables when they are declared</li>
      <li>Once a variable has been assigned, don't be changing it</li>
      <li>Don't erase state: create new state instead!</li>
      <li>Unreassignable !== immutable</li>
    </ol>
