## Functions are the basic unit of reusability

<h3 id=''>Functions take at least one argument</h3>
<h3 id=''>Functions return exactly one result</h3>
<h3 id=''>Functions can be passed as arguments to other functions</h3>
<h3 id=''>Functions can be returned from other functions</h3>
<h3 id=''>Functions can call functions, including themselves</h3>
<h3 id=''>Given the same arguments, functions must return the same result</h3>
<h3 id=''>Don't be reaching outside the function to mess with shit</h3>
<h3 id=''>Make copies when passing by reference</h3>
<h3 id=''>Functions can remember things for you</h3>
