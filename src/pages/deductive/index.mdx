**FP is easy, but it can seem difficult at first.**

Functional programming (FP) is a programming paradigm, meaning that it is a way of thinking about software construction based on some fundamental, defining principles. Other examples of programming paradigms include object-oriented programming (OOP) and procedural programming.

## Why Functional Programming?

Functional code tends to be more concise, more predictable, and easier to test than imperative or object-oriented code&mdash;but if you're unfamiliar with it and the common patterns associated with it, then functional code can also seem a lot more dense.

Functional Programming revolves around the idea that a program is made of a set of functions and that they follow certain rules. Forget classes and inheritance: the patterns that you will encounter are quite different here.

FP is the process of building software by:

* composing _pure functions_ and,
* avoiding _shared state_, _mutable data_, and _side-effects_. 

Let's learn more about these concepts...

### Which languages follow which paradigms? (For the curious...)

You might be very surprised. Purely FP, OOP, or procedural langauges are fairly rare. Many langagues begin with a procedural base and then add FP and/or OOP features. Among these are some very popular langauges commonly considered object-oriented.

C++, C#, Java, and JavaScript are all procedural languages with features of object-oriented languages and functional programming languages. Java in particular has been moving quickly in a functional direction, perhaps spurred on by Scala, which is a multi-paradigm competitor to Java.

In JavaScript (ECMAScript), the move toward a strongly functional paradigm has been accelerating annually for several years.

BASIC, C, COBOL, and Fortran are examples of procedural languages still in use.

Object-oriented languages as most of us know them should really be called "class-oriented", as they make a distinction between classes and instances. Some languages are purely OO, for example Ruby, in which _everything_ is an object. Scala has classes and inheritance, but also strong functional features.

JavaScript is actually an object-oriented _prototype-based_ language, which means is lacks the distinction between classes and instances, although the recent (and controversial) addition of "class" syntax hides this a bit. But JavaScript has reasonably strong functional capabilities, and they get stronger with each new version.

Popular object-oriented _class-based_ languages include C++, C#, Java (and Groovy), Objective-C, Perl 5, PHP 5, Python, Ruby, and Scala.

Popular functional programming languages include Erlang and Elixir, F#, Groovy, JavaScript, Java (since version 8), Kotlin, Lisp, Perl 6, PHP, Python, Ruby, Rust, and Scala. **Pure** functional programming languages include Elm, Haskell, and PureScript.

As you can see, most of the popular languages are now multi-paradigm. Ruby, for example, is a "pure" object-oriented class-based language (everything is an object), but Ruby can still be used in a very functional style (and this style is often recommended strongly).

There are many ways to classify programming languages. If you're interested, check out this [list of programming languages by type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages_by_type#Procedural_languages). Note how many languages appear under many different types.
